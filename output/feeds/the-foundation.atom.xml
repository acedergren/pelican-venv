We need to know our compnays tech, but we also need to know our customers tech, becase the best solutions (and deals) is created when there i no guess work.

So far I used a bunch of technologies and I will share posts about all of them in the future. But to list a few so far, Python and Pelican, Linode Objectstore, Akamai Edge Delivery and Security,  Docker and last but not least I've had to really understand VS code for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
