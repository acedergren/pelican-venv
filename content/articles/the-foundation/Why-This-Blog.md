As an SE we need to know a milion things. We need to know our compnays tech, but we also need to know our customers tech, becase the best solutions (and deals) is created when there i no guess work. I found this to be interesting to share, both how I learn new things like Python and how to share insights in scoping of projects and understanding of what tech my customers is currently using

## Self Learning

**Knowledge is Power:** I needed to brush up on my skills on programming so whats better then creating something meaningful along the way, like this blog. So far I used a bunch of technologies and I will share posts about all of them in the future. But to list a few so far, Python and Pelican, Linode Objectstore, Akamai Edge Delivery and Security,  Docker and last but not least I've had to really understand VS code for the first time.
